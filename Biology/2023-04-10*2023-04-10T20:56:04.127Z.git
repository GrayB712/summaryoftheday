<br><br><b><u>Graydon Bruyn</u></b>: We took notes from 32.1 to 32.2. The slides should be on Google Classroom. We then got the structure of the heart and respiratory system worksheet, which is due Friday with the test.
She also told us that tomorrow she will be gone and that we will be given back our chapter tests and our notes. We are to use a colored pen, and for each question on the test, write the question's number in our notes next to the section of our notes where that question is discussed. If we turn in our notes on Friday, with test question numbers written in, she will give us 15 points of bonus.
