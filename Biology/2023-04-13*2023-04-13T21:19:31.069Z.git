<b><u>Graydon Bruyn</u></b>: We had a vocab quiz over what we learned on Tuesday. (32.1-32.2) Today we went through 32.6 on our notes. Remember to do the study questions, the heart and lungs worksheet, and the bonus notes assignment for Tuesday. On Friday, we will finish our notes and then have a "snow day" to play games in class. On Monday, we will be in the Centennial Gym doing exercises and measuring heart/breathing rates.<br>
