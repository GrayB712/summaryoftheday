<br><br><b><u>Graydon Bruyn</u></b>: He told us that we will have a test on Thursday over the medieval Arthur story, the Lancelot story, the modern Arthur story, the Don Quixote story, and the Man of la Mancha story. We will be given an excerpt, and must identify which story it is from, and it's significance/theme. We will be able to study for this test on Wednesday, when Mr. Cummins isn't there.
