<br><br><b><u>Graydon Bruyn</u></b>: We started chapter 8, "food". We went over the new vocabulary, and discovered that chips and queso in Spanish is "chips y queso" (The "i" is pronounced "ee").
We then started working on a worksheet that included a true and false listening exercise, a "which of these does not belong" exercise, and another fill in the blank listening exercise. We didn't finish it and will work on it in class tommorow.
